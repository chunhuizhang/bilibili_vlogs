# MonkeyTest

MonkeyTest -- a disk benchmark to test your hard drive read-write speed in Python

A simplistic script to show that such system programming
tasks are possible and convenient to be solved in Python

I haven't done any command-line arguments parsing, so
you should configure it using the constants at top of the script.

The file is being created, then written with random data, randomly read
and deleted, so the script doesn't waste your drive

(!) Be sure, that the file you point to is not smthng
    you need, cause it'll be overwritten during test
    
Runs on both Python3 and 2, despite that I prefer 3. 
Has been tested on 3.5 and 2.7 under ArchLinux
